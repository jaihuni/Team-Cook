Contributed to UI of the task 2, ingredients amount optimization.

- Table of the ingredients and input box for each.
- Select box for "Serving for n-people".
- Button for modify confirmation.
- Alert for user input exception.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, our team had team meetings on online via Zoom. This was very fresh but unfamiliar experience, and it leads us to bad work efficiency at first. However, unnecessary times as transportation was gone by getting used to online meeting. Consequently, we could reduce a lot of unnecessary times and have efficient work.

In terms of teamwork, I think our team had a problem in communication. While implementing a prototype, we experienced a situation that couple of members are on the same part. After that, we tried to clarify which part each is doing. The lesson which I learned from the experience is that clarifying each one's role and having an active communication during the work is important.

From the entire design project experience, I learned that user testing in a prototype stage is significant. User's expectation on UI is sometimes completely different from developer's expectation. We cannot gather enough feedbacks from peer evaluation, there must be a feedback from users. By doing so, a lot of times which could be spent in developing unnecessary features can be saved.

I contributed to the UI of task1, getting suggested recipes from input ingredients.

- All functions of the Recipe Suggestion page (suggest.js)
- Layout (initial design) of Recipe Suggestion page

Since our team couldn't meet in person, we faced the hurdles of online meetings. They tended to drag on since people just stopped talking when they ran out of ideas. Initially those prolonged silences were really awkward, but later they actually helped with brainstorming as I was free to look over materials without being self-conscious.

Minor difficulties arose from differences in desired working time due to our different schedules. They were mostly solved through the use of GitHub and more frequent communication through Kakao Talk.

Throughout the project I learned that communication, both between developers and between the user and developer was important. A misunderstanding that arose while discussing ideas on design or functions could lead to extra time spent on clarification. Without a person to lead the conversation everybody could just give up on talking.

Also when first making the implementation, I thought that keeping a user's options open, i.e., giving the user more ways to accomplish a certain task, would be more user-friendly. The user testing proved me wrong. Limiting the number of ways to accomplish a task, such as adding ingredients to a list, could actually reduce confusion from users and make the implementation less complex.
