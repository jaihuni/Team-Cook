Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, our team had team meetings on online via Zoom. This was very fresh but unfamiliar experience, and it leads us to bad work efficiency at first. However, unnecessary times as transportation was gone by getting used to online meeting. Consequently, we could reduce a lot of unnecessary times and have efficient work.

In terms of teamwork, I think our team had a problem in communication. While implementing a prototype, we experienced a situation that couple of members are on the same part. After that, we tried to clarify which part each is doing. The lesson which I learned from the experience is that clarifying each one's role and having an active communication during the work is important.

From the entire design project experience, I learned that user testing in a prototype stage is significant. User's expectation on UI is sometimes completely different from developer's expectation. We cannot gather enough feedbacks from peer evaluation, there must be a feedback from users. By doing so, a lot of times which could be spent in developing unnecessary features can be saved.
