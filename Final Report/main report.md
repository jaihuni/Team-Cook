#### Quality arguments

Most novice cookers do not seek to complete a perfect dish; they want a meal that tastes 'good.' Our interface provides that function, and also informs users which ingredients are essential to producing a dish's signature taste. This allows them to leave out ingredients that are undesired or currently nonexistent. As one of our user test participants commented, one wants to remodel recipes to suit their taste but doesn't know how. In addition the tradeoff between simplicity and quality can be adjusted to fit the cook's taste, instead of only providing two options.

The cooking time function was also highly praised during our user test(s); it was commented as an improvement over YouTube videos that do not inform viewers of the total time required. (124)

## Iteration 

Our goal was to improve the learnability of the prototype. To do so, we resolved 3 ciritical usability problems found from the user testing.

- Placed a text "Amount" above the amount input boxes.
  - Some users thought that the amount input boxes are displaying other information as calories. Also, it was hard for users to recognize what they have to do at a glance. For better learnability, we placed a text "Amount" above the input boxes so that a user can have confidence with their action.
- Placed 'Modify Amount' button at bottom.
  - 'Modify Amount' button placed at top was not noticeable when a user finished input. Thus, we placed 'Modify Amount' button at bottom so that a user can easily notice the button.
- Removed checkboxes beside the necessary steps.
  - Purpose of the checkboxes were unclear and a user had a trouble with noticing a difference between necessary/optional steps. Rather than placing a checkmark beside every step, we removed checkboxes beside the necessary steps and placed it only beside the optional steps. This could make a user easier to notice that the user can only manipulate optional steps.

From the iteration, we learned that continuous effort for improvement is important.

- Select box for "Serving for n-people".
- Button for modify confirmation.
- Alert for user input exception.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, our team had team meetings on online via Zoom. This was very fresh but unfamiliar experience, and it leads us to bad work efficiency at first. However, unnecessary times as transportation was gone by getting used to online meeting. Consequently, we could reduce a lot of unnecessary times and have efficient work.

In terms of teamwork, I think our team had a problem in communication. While implementing a prototype, we experienced a situation that couple of members are on the same part. After that, we tried to clarify which part each is doing. The lesson which I learned from the experience is that clarifying each one's role and having an active communication during the work is important.

From the entire design project experience, I learned that user testing in a prototype stage is significant. User's expectation on UI is sometimes completely different from developer's expectation. We cannot gather enough feedbacks from peer evaluation, there must be a feedback from users. By doing so, a lot of times which could be spent in developing unnecessary features can be saved.

I contributed to the UI of task1, getting suggested recipes from input ingredients.

- Layout (initial design) of Recipe Suggestion page

Since our team couldn't meet in person, we faced the hurdles of online meetings. They tended to drag on since people just stopped talking when they ran out of ideas. Initially those prolonged silences were really awkward, but later they actually helped with brainstorming as I was free to look over materials without being self-conscious.

Minor difficulties arose from differences in desired working time due to our different schedules. They were mostly solved through the use of GitHub and more frequent communication through Kakao Talk.

Throughout the project I learned that communication, both between developers and between the user and developer was important. A misunderstanding that arose while discussing ideas on design or functions could lead to extra time spent on clarification. Without a person to lead the conversation everybody could just give up on talking.

Also when first making the implementation, I thought that keeping a user's options open, i.e., giving the user more ways to accomplish a certain task, would be more user-friendly. The user testing proved me wrong. Limiting the number of ways to accomplish a task, such as adding ingredients to a list, could actually reduce confusion from users and make the implementation less complex.
